THE VIST OF THE FRENCH FLEET.
The official program of the festivities in connection with the visit of the French fleet leaves nothing to be desired. His Majesty the King will review the French Fleet, Admiral Caillard and his gallant and distinguished staff will be his guests, and are specially invited to witness the races for the King’s Cup. Windsor Castle is to be thrown open to our friendly rivals, and we may be sure that our Ruler has still some pleasant surprises in store for his guests. The City of London follows the example of the King ; Portsmouth may be trusted to live up to its reputation, and last but not least, the two Houses will entertain the French officers in Westminster Hall. Six years agp who could have proposed that the centenary year of the Trafalgar would be marked by the fraternisation of the French and British Fleets at Portsmouth following on the friendly visit of a Spanish King to London  Yet nothing could be more necessary in the the interests of the peaces of the world, than the “entente cordiale” between two nations whose ideals as to progress and liberty are identical, whose mutual commercial interests increase daily and whose ancient quarrels have become a source of mutual respect. Our soldiers and sailors have not always had the best of the give and take.  If the British Fleets swept the seas under Nelson and Collingwood, they were well nigh swept from the seas during the later years of the American war, when Guioben and Suffren commanded victorious squadrons of which any Admiral might
have been proud, and though we triumphed under the leadership of the great Iron Duke and the greater Marlborough, the names of Froute noy, Lauffeld, Steinkirk, and neerwinden attest that even the soldiers who swore- and fought- so terribly in Flanders often met their match. Let us,rather, while remembering our victories, forget against whom they were gained and while profiting by out defeats cease to underline in our minds the name of the conqueror. Thus Crecy and Bovines, Hastings and Waterloo, may became names of peaceful omen. We remember a passage in an English novel- alas! the author;s name has escaped us- that bears on this point. Two Englishmen meet in the one guest-room of a tiny hotel in Ireland. Both eye one another over their pipes and one suddenly exclaimed, “Excuse me, but-er-didn’t we meet last behind the fives courts at X…” “Yes,” replies the other, laughing, “and call-over stopped it after the fifth round ;” and the two discuss their old school-days and school quarrels with the greatest good humor in the world. May such be the relations of France and England in the future. They have led a wild and rather quarrelsome youth, they have fought one another out of sheer pugnacity, or out of mutual jealously born of the other’s attentions to various colored enchantresses in Asia and Africa and the Spanish Main, but they are settling down now to a law-abiding and steady middle age. John is ready to admit that Jacques is a right good fellow in spite of his theatrical manner, and Jacques in convinced that John’s reserve hides a warm and friendly heart and both are inclined to think more fondly of Edward the Peacemaker and President Loubet that of William the Conqueror and the Edward who took Calais. Their old war-songs cease to call up memories of battle and Marot;s refrain. “Car France est cimitiere aux Anglsis” and Drayton’s ballad of Agincourt appeal to day to mixed audiences. 


THE MARSHALL ISLANDS
Australian sensitiveness in connection with German aggressiveness in the Marshall Islands is not likely to be blunted by any tranquilising assurance from minor officials. To give strength and validity to such undertakings,, it is essential that they should come direct from Prince von Bulow. Australians will want to know, therefore, whether the German Consul at Sydney had the Chancellor;s authority for stating that the new laws for the government of the insular group will be framed “in accordance with Australians wishes.” Until about 20 years ago, England and Germany had practically the same footing in the islands. But Downing street, fearing that this dual control might breed future complications, as between England and France in the New Hebrides, gravely affronted Australian sentiment by consenting to the establishment of a German Protectorate. It was strictly covenanted, however, that the than “open door,” should remain open. But Teutonio smartness hit on an expedient to close it. The administrative control, including all fiscal arrangements was handed over to a private commercial concern,  the Jaluit Company, which at once proceeded to build up a trading monopoly for its own exclusive profit. One method was the imposition of a duty of L3 per ton on exports in Australian vessels ; but to give this arbitrary act a show of fairness, the same burden was placed on German ship engaged in the business, and so whatsoever sum t disbursed for export duty came back to its treasury as revenue. Australians will wait to see whether Prince von Bulow is of the same mind as this Consular spokesman of his at Sydney.

<p>New York, August 5.
M. Witte and Baron Rosen paid a visit to
President Roosevelt at Oyster Bay, similar to
that of Baron Kamoura and M. Takashira last
week, with the object of informally eating
their respects prior to to-day’s formal reception.
It is stated that the question of precedence 
        today has been decided in favor of Japan. (R.)</p>

<p>WASHINGTON, August 5.
The plenipotentiaries have arrived at Oyster
Bay. The envoys were received by President
Roosevelt on board the Government yacht 
Mayflower. The Japanese preceded the Russians.

<p>OYSTER BAY, August 5.
Mr. Witte handed a letter from the Tsar 
to Mr. Roosevelt yesterday.
Mr. Roosevelt gave a lunch to the Russian
and Japanese plenipotentiaries. In his toast
he expressed an ardent wish for the conclusion 
        of a just and lasting peace. (Haus.)</p>

<p>WASHINGTON, August 6.
	President Roosevelt presented the envoys 
to each other. A luncheon then followed, at
which Mr. Roosevelt proposed a toast to the 
welfare and prosperity of the two great nations,
saying that it was his earnest prayer in the 
interest of all mankind, that a just and last-
ing peace may be speedily concluded. The

introduced. Before leaving, the Japanese ex-
pressed professional gratification at the pleasant

<p>ST. PETERSBURG, August 5.
Despite the opposition of the reactionary
party, the Council of the Empire which met 
at Peterhof has decided that no bill rejected 
by a two-thirds majority shall be submitted
for the Tsar’s sanction. If the bill be rejected
by less that two-thirds majority, reports, both 
form the majority and minority, will be sub-
fitted to the Tsar, who will decide between 
the two. This decision is important in solving 
the introduction of the first check on the
        autocratic power. (Reuter.)</p>

<p>ST. PETERSBURG, August 3. 
The Grand Council has decided to accept 
the project of M. Bouliguine, constitution an

<p>DROWNING FATALITY.- Th body of a native

handed it over to the police. It was taken to

caused entirely by drowning, there being no
        suspicion of foul play. </p>

<p>ALHAMBRA THEATER.- Pressure on our space
unfortunately compels us to hold over
our repot of the excellent opening performance

<p>BRAWL IN A CAFE.- The Café Imperial was
the scene of a quarrel on Saturday evening
which resulted in a tradesman of Jewish 
origin, who is, we believe, a British subject,
receiving three serious stabs between the
shoulders with a stiletto, which were inflicted
by the nephew of the injured man. Dispute

        assault.</p> 

<p>THE PLAUGE.- Staurday’s plague bulletin
reports the death of a native street-cleaner of
Satret el Bahir district of Alexandria, who was
found dead at his house. Sunday’s bulletin 
reports two admissions to hospital and three
deaths at Alexandria, and also one death at 
Port Said. The new cases at Alexandria are
those of an Italian grocer of the Chimerly
district, and a native street-cleaner of the 
Echeches Ragheb Pasha. The three cases
which ended fatally were all natives, one being
the nephew of the second case admitted to 
hospital yesterday, who was found dead at his
home, another was a native workman who had
 been working in the same shop as the case 
reported in Saturday, and the third was a
native workman found dead at his home in 
        Saladin.</p>

<p>MESSIEURS. WALKER AND MEIMARACHI, LTD.
formally inaugurated their reconstructed bar
in Old Bourse Palace- which has risen,
Phoenix-like, from its ashes- on Saturday even-
ing by inviting the members of the local press
to a “champagne de press.” The guests had
thus an pooprtunity of inspecting the rea;;y
magnificent appointments of the bar at their
leisure while enjoying a glass of Montebello. The
up-to-date manner, and nothing has been
overlooked that could ass to the comfort and
convenience of clients. The artistic decora-
tions, which are usually gorgeous and 
reflect the greatest credit on the designer, 
Prof. Kirchmayr, make the establishment
one of the most inviting of the kind we have
yet seen, The scheme of decoration of the 
front part of the bar is carried out is “art
nounvean,” while the back parlor is a gem of
arabesque work, being entirely furnished with
masharabieh and bass furniture from Messers. 
Tara’s workshops. Here, besides enjoying 
the refreshments supplied, one may read the
latest newspapers and magazines in the great-
best ease and comfort. Altogether, the place is
really worth a visit, and Messers. W. and M. are
to be congratulated on affording Alexandria
such a pleasant place of meeting, A feature
of the establishment is the commissionaries who
        is an imposing figure of something like 7 feet. </p>

                <head>THE SUN’S ECLIPES.</head>

                <head>MISSIONS LEAVE FOR ASSOUAN. </head>

<p>The maulers of the British and American
astronomical missions which have been sent
out in order to observe the forthcoming eclipse
of the sun have arrived in Cairo and leave for
Assouan this evening, accompanied by Captian
Lyons. Captain Lyons will return to Cario on 
August 31, bu the date of return of the mis-
sions is not yet fixed. Another expedition
consisting of Russian savants, is due to arrive 
        in Egypt shortly.</p>
	<p>On August 30 the moon passes exactly
between the sun and our earth, and produces
the comparatively rare phenomenon of a total 
                eclipse of the sun.</p>
	<p>It is only on such occasions that the corona 
or halo of light which surrounds the sun, can 
be seen at all, and it is in consequence of this 
fact that astronomers journey to distant parts 
of the earth from which the eclipsed sun can 
                be observed.</p>
	<p>For European observers the line of totality
of the approaching eclipse is very conveniently 
placed, so that it can be reached quiet easily
and at a small expense. The elliptical shadow 
of the moon on the earth’s surface moves from 
Hudson’s Bay to Arabia, so that the path 
traced out is considerable length, but only
                about 120 miles broad.</p>
	<p>To observe the corona, therefore it is neces-
say to place oneself somewhere on this small
strip of the the earth’s surface. After leaving the 
American continent at Labrador, the shadow
sweeps across the Atlantic and strikes Europe
near Cape Ortega, in the north-west of Spain,
passes over Spanish territory, convenient
towns traversed being Oviedo, Valencia, Bur-
dos, Ateca, Calatayud, and Castellón. The
shadow then crosses the Mediterranean, pass-
ing over the islands of Majoroa and Ivisa and
cuts the African continent near Philippeville
and Callo, in Algeria. in its eastward course it
falls on Sfax in Tunia, and numerous coast 
stated in Tripoli, and towards the end of its
career passes over Egypt near Assouan, and
                finally terminates in Arabia. </p>
	<p>the facts that the eclipse occurs in the
month of Augustm when many people can
afford the time to visit Southern Europe, that
the track is comparatively near home, that
totality last for over three minutes, and fi-
nally that this is the only total solar eclipse
that can be easily reaches from England for
some years to come, account for the great
                popular interest attached to this event.</p>
	<p>Astronomers have been making very exten-
sive preparations for securing as many photo-
graphs and observations as possible, and,
according to present arrangements they are
about to take up their stations along this
                narrow line.</p>
	<p>The names of the astronomers who are 
leaving for Assouan this evening are Mr. 
Keeling, mr. Joy, Dr. West, Mr. Ballamy
                Professor H. Turner, and Dr. and Mrs. Hausey.</p>


                <head>EGYPTIAN ARMY.</head>

<p>Leave of absence has been granted to the 
following officials of the Sudan Government
and Army officers until the undermentioned 
        dates:-</p>
<p>El Kaimakam Herbert Bey, Assistant Adju-
cant General, Recruiting, until November 1;
El Kaimakam Pearson Bey. Director of Sur-
vets, until September 18; EL Bimbashi Das
-sey-Browning, Medical Corps, until October
15; El Bimbasbi Potter, 16th Battalion, until
October 19; EL Kaimaskam Wood Bey, officer 
commanding 2nd Battalion and EL Bimbasbi 
Ryan. D.S.O, 15th Sudanese have received
extension of leave until August 31 and Sep-
        member 13 respectively.</p>
<p>Lieut. E. st. G. Loather, Royal Artillery
who arrived in Egypt on the 14th of last 
month, is taken in the strength of the Egypt-
ian Army with the rank of Bimbashi and is 
        posted to the Artillery.</p>

                <head>NILE GAUGE READINGS.</head>
                
<p>The non-arrival of the gauge readings from 
Rosaries since the 20th of the last month is due 
to the fact that the telegraph office has been
closed on account of the illness of th clerk. 
On Saturday last the office was still closed
but the irrigation inspector telegraphed the
missing reading of the last month from Slings, a
station some thirty miles from Rosaries and
        we are now able to complete our July table. </p>
<p>We can easily understand the inconvenience 
which would be caused by the illness of a 
telegraph clerk in such a remote district and
the difficulty of replacing him at a moment’s
notice, but the Telegraph Administration must
have now been aware of the fact for about 
a fortnight. It is a very serious matter to 
deprive the public of telegraphic communica-
tion to any station for even the shortest period
but when a telegraph office is closed for
more than a fortnight, merely on account 
of a clerk’s illness, it would seem that 
the authorities show a considerable disregard 
for the public which takes some interest in the 
        Nile flood.</p>

        <head>AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY.</head>
        <head>HIDDEN TREASURE AT</head>
        <head>TOUKH EL GARAMOUS.</head>

<p>A Tell or mound, close to the village of
Touch el Garamous, in the Facous district,
has yielded a magnificent treasure to the
Antiquities Service. It appears that a few
months agate Government authorised a 
rich proprietor of the neighbourhood to take
sebakh from the mound and with that object
gangs if villagers not to work to dig outtings
into the Tell, which rises some 10 metres
above the surrounding lines, and a Deauville 
railways was constructed to remove the loads
        of sebakh as fast as they were dug out.</p>
<p>The Government had prudently inserted a 
clause in the contract insisting on all the
necessary precautions being taken to protect
an antiquities that might be discovered 
during the digging, and the Antiquities Ser-
vice posted a ghaffir on the spot who was
charge to protect its interests. In August 3
the ghaffir  was riding over the Tell on a 
donkey, when the beast suddenly came down 
heavily. The rider after picking himself up,
found that one of the ass’s forelegs had gone
through the roof of a vault. He enlarged the 
opening and saw a treasure; two or three
watchers rushed to the spot, the village follow-
ed in a body, and the nearest omdeh was sent
        for. </p>
<p>Lord Cromer, in his report for 1904 re-
marks that causes have come before him in
which omdehs have shown the most praise-
worthy tact and presence of mind. The omdeh
of Toukh el Garamous Ahmad Effendi And ed
Ali, appears to have possessed the ;after virtue
in a high degree. Finding the gaffer executing 
the villagers of desiring to steal the objects in 
the vault and the villagers accusing the gaffer
of having already stolen most of them the
omdeh kept the crowd away called up the 
sheikhs and ordered them to guard the vault 
for the night wired to the Antiquities Service
and the Momour of th earkas and though we 
cannot guarantee the last item, put the ghaffir 
under observation. He then took an inventory 
                             of the objects discovered.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 3rd inst. the native
Inspector of the Antiquities Service came up
from Faoour. The Inspector from Zagazig 
followed next day, and the treasure about 
which the energetic omdah and the sheik
had camped all nights put under guard
Saab, according to out informants, are the de-
tails of this most interesting discovery. If
the list of the objects discovered, which 
we have received is substantially accurate it is 
obvious that a find of the highest impor-
        dance and value has been made.</p> 
<p>Here are some of the principle objects which 
have been inventoried- 2 silver bowls. one
of them gilt, 2 candlesticks, a silver crown
a silver figure of a cock, part of the head of a 
silver statuette covered with gold lead, a
pair of gold polished bracelets with the clapse
carved in the shape of a bird with a housing 
face, a bracelet with the figure of Horus on the 
catch a gold bracelet shaped like a serpents
with a red stone set in the head, a golden 
diadem set with jewels, nine plates of silver
a chased silver bowl, 17 silver and 118 gold 
coins, th leather bearing either the head of
        monarch, or the figures of a bird, etc. etc.</p>
<p>We imagine from the appearance of the coins
is this list that the treasure will prove to be
Roman or Psolemaic. Owing to the absence of
all its European inspectors the Antiquities 
Service at Cario has been unable to furnish
        us with any information on the subject.</p>

        <head>NOTES FROM PORT SAID.</head>

        <head>A REMARKABLE TOW.</head>

        <head>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT )</head>

        <p>Port Said, Sunday.</p>
<p>We had here yesterday a large tug, the
Oceans on her return voyage from Saborg 
in Sumatra. This vessel on the 9th May
was sighted coming in from the sea, having in
tow a large vessel evidently much larger than 
herself. The Oceans of 115 tons net, and her
consort the Tankerville whose tonnage was
2320 had come out form Eastern Europe in 
17 days, and although the monsoon is 
blowing all the time in the Arabian sea, they
proceeded and eventually arrived in safety. 
This tow, both for its length (over 8000 miles)
and its freedom form serious accident is well
worthy of note. I was informed that all went 
well on the voyage the tug coaling form her
tow as occasions demanded and that but little 
occurred to mar the success of what is one of
the greatest tows with have been made for
some years. THE Tankerskille is an oil vessel 
intended for the carriage of petroleum on the
        Sumatra coast.</p>


        <head>THE MATIANA.</head>

<p>The Matiana (which vessel went badly ashore
on Friday and completely blocked all traffic
for some time) is now anchor in Lake Tim-
san (Ismailia ) undergoing repairs to her steering
gear, a defect in which was the cause of the 
        accident, She will probably leave on Monday.</p>

        <head>HARBOR IMPROVEMENTS </head>
<p>A tremendous amount of work in being done
on downs Poiut in anticipation of the con-
striation of stored and warehouses. Roads are
being altered stretches of land leveled and
quantities of sand are being removed to the 
Lake ashore near the spot where in the near
future will be built the MAtarieh canal 
        terminus</p>
<p>The “Chantier des Bloca” has also been 
much altered half being cut away and walls
having been built to protect the banks
of what is intended to bed in the future 
the danger anborges The eastern side of 
the aneborge approach will be protected by a
stone breakwater a large portion of which is
already completed. The bathing house are I
believe to be pulled down at the end of the 
summer and the site noe occupied by them is
to be dredged to a depth of 8 metres This 
will permit of dredgers hoppers and craft of
a like nature all going into their berths and
maneuvering quite clear of all the sea-going
traffic instead of as at permit using the 
main channels and frequently greatly disturb-
        ing the harbour traffic. </p>

        this date were drawn.</p>

<p>A.C.C ROYAL BERKSHIRE REGIMENT 
	Played on Saturday last. The regiment 
won the toss and sent in Capt. Moore and 
Mr. Strange who made a fair start putting 
on 23, when the former fell to a fast ball from 
Maclarei. A collapse followed six wickets
going down for 39, and though Capt. Binglay
and Pta. Webb added a few by hitting out,
that total for the innings was only 13. H.B.
Carver was the most successful of the 
Club bowlers. With an easy task before
them, the A.C.C. bataman treated the regi-
ment’s bowling with a great want of respect,
and after Maclaren had left at 16, H.B.
Carver and Stacey did what they pleased till
the score reached 175, when Carver, in getting 
back to hook a lob, trod on his wicket. His 
innings of 101 was marked by great vigour 
and brilliancy and he gave no chances till he
had made 78, when he might have been 
caught twice and stumped once. Macaulay 
who came in next, hit extremely freely all
round the wicket and was not out when stumps
were drawn, with a vigorous 77 to his credit.
Stacey, who played with more freedom than 
usual, carried out his bat for a chanceless 87
the club thus winning easily and decisively.
